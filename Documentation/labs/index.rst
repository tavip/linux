Linux device driver labs
========================

This documentation is a collection of "howtos" for various device
driver topics. For each topic there are two parts:

* a walk-through the topic which contains an overview, the main
  abstractions, simple examples and pointers to APIs

* a hands-on part which contains a few exercises that should be
  resolved by the student; to focus on the topic at hand, the student
  is presented with a starting coding skeleton and with in-depth tips
  on how to solve the exercises
